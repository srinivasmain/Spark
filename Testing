# Code Analysis:

## 1. Extraction of Relevant Columns:
   - The code extracts relevant columns from the `table_details_df` and `ast_relation_df`, storing them in `hive_tbl_dtls_df` and `ast_tables_hierarchy_df`, respectively.
   - The selected columns include "tableName," "databaseName," and "cluster_info" from `table_details_df`.
   - For `ast_relation_df`, the selected columns are 'CLUSTER_NAME', 'SCHEMA_NAME', 'TABLE_ASSET_ID' (aliased as 'ast_id'), 'TABLE ASSET TYPE ID', and 'TABLE ASSET NAME'.

## 2. Joining DataFrames:
   - An inner join is performed between `ast_relation_df` and `hive_tbl_dtls_df` to create `dcm_hive_inner_df`. The join conditions include matching cluster, database, and table names.
   - The resulting DataFrame is displayed to provide insights into the joined data.

## 3. Joining Additional DataFrame:
   - `col_joined_df` is created by performing a left join between `dcm_hive_inner_df` and `col_details_df`. The join conditions involve matching cluster, database, table, and column names.
   - The joined DataFrame is displayed to show the combined information.

## 4. Filtering and Displaying Results:
   - The code filters rows in `col_joined_df` where the "columnName" is null, indicating unmatched columns, and drops duplicate rows to create `res_df`.
   - The results are displayed, providing visibility into the unmatched columns in the context of the specified criteria.

## 5. Considerations:
   - The code assumes the existence of appropriate columns in the provided DataFrames. Ensure the actual column names match those used in the code.
   - The left join between `dcm_hive_inner_df` and `col_details_df` allows for identification of unmatched columns in the resulting DataFrame.

## 6. Output:
   - The main output of the code is the DataFrame `res_df`, which contains rows with unmatched columns based on the specified conditions.

## 7. Conclusion:
   - The code effectively performs column matching and identification of unmatched columns between Hive and Oracle DataFrames. It provides insights into the discrepancies and can be further customized based on specific requirements.
